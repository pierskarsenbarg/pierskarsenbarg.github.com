This is where you can find some of the coding that I've been writing for
public consumption. Most likely it's all going to be .NET based (and more than
likely C# too, but since you can compile it easily enough to work with your
VB.NET projects there shouldn't be a problem).

I'm hosting all over at Github for two reasons:

1. It's free 2. It gives me a chance to take a good look at git as a form of
source control.
