I'm Piers Karsenbarg, a 29 year old web developer living in Lomdon, UK.

I've been keeping a blog for about eight years now, although due to a crappy
host a while back I lost about three years worth of posts and comments. I've
recently found that the WayBack machine has most of them stored, so I'm
starting to piece it back together. Although this is a public site, I don't
write it for anyone other than me. If you like reading it then awesome! You
can subscribe to the [feed](http://piersonthe.net/feed) by clicking on the

You can see all the ways to get in touch with me [here](/contact/).
