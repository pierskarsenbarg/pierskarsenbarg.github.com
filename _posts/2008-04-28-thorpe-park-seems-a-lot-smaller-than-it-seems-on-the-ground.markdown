I was looking up [Thorpe Park](http://www.thorpepark.com/) on t'internet (I'm
going there in a few weeks time) and was looking at how to get there on Google
Maps.

The last time I went there was in October and it seemed quite big, area wise.
But having looked on [Google Maps](http://tinyurl.com/6qhvck), it looks really
small.
