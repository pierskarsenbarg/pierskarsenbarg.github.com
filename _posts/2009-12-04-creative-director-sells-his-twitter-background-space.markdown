Our Creative Director here at [Pull Digital](http://www.pulldigital.com/),
Paul Stratford, in an attempt to raise some extra cash for the coming holiday
season has decided to put the background of his [Twitter
profile](http://bit.ly/53I1rK) up for sale. We all called him crazy for doing
so, but it seems to have taken off, with adverts from [The Appliance
Warehouse](http://www.taw-sales.co.uk/?utm_source=pulldigital&utm_medium=piers
blog&utm_campaign=december09) and [Pure Triumph](http://www.pure-triumph.com/?
utm_source=pulldigital&utm_medium=piersblog&utm_campaign=december09) already
making an appearance.

If you'd like to see your logo there, bidding starts at 99p per box to be seen
by all his followers for an indefinite time and he'll stop taking applications
when all the spaces have been filled.

Email [paul@pulldigital.com](mailto:paul@pulldigital.com) for more
information.
