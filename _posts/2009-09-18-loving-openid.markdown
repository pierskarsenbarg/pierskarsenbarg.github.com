I love [OpenID](http://openid.net/). I've been using it for quite a while but
recently found and installed [a
plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/) to this very blog to
enable it as an OpenID provider (if you don't have a blog that you can use as
a provider then there is a pretty good list of a lot of well known sites that
also acts as [OpenID providers](http://openid.net/get-an-openid/).

So now, rather than logging in using lots of different user IDsÂ or and
passwords, you can just use one. So now, I just tap in the URL to my blog and
I never have to worry about it again.
