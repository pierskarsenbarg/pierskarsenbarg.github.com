As you can see from my post on Summer Films 2009 I seem to be getting through
them fairly quickly. The only one I haven't seen that't been out is X-Men
Origins: Wolverine, but I'm hoping that it's still in the cinemas somewhere.
I'm hopefully going to see Transformers at some point over the next couple of
weeks and then it's just a case of waiting until the rest come out in the
cinema.
