Ok so I've had my new phone for two days now and I'm absolutely loving it.
It's fast phone-wise, it's fast internet-wise (thanks to T-Mobile's HSPDA
network) and is a joy to use. In fact I'm writing this post on it now, using
the Wordpress Android app of course.

The screen (which I believe is an OLED display) is beautiful, crisp and clear
and incredibly responsive and I'm quite happily typing this pretty quickly.

The camera is also very good. It's only 5 megapixels, but that's more than
enough for me.

So, all in all it's a really pleasurable phone to use. I love Android as an
operating system and I would gladly have it rather than an iPhone any day.
