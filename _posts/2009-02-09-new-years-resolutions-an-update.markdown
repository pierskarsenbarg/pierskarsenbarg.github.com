Ok, I'd like to draw your eye back to my post on my [New Years'
Resolutions](http://piersonthe.net/2009/01/02/new-years-resolutionsnew-years-
resolutions/) that I posted at the beginning of last month. If you haven't
read it yet feel free to... I'll wait....

Ok, done? Right. Well, I'm very pleased to say that I've started one of them,
and completed another! So, my list now looks like the following:

  1. Start an LLB with the OU - not for any career purposes. I just want to do. It's only part time so it will take a good 5-6 years to do.
  2. Start work on one of my start-up ideas - I have a few at the moment but don't seem to have time to sit down and make a start on any of them. That's going to change!
  3. Actively search down more freelance work - this has been pretty static over the past few years, but I'd like to get back into it. I've got a couple of things in the pipeline which should come to fruition soon.
  4. One more - try to hunt down (through Google cache and the way back machine) some of the old posts that were deleted by the crappy people at Netbunch (I would link through to them, but it seems the domain name is up for sale. Funny that)
  5. And another - That tattoo I want of [the dragon](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/96282904/)? Yup I'm going to get it done this year (hopefully sooner rather than later) - I've taken a couple of photos, but haven't got around to uploading them yet.
I've kind of started number 1. I have at least pre-registered for my first
module. So although I've not officially started, I've at least got the ball
rolling.
