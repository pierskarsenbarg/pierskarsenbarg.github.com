layer.png)It's finally week 15 of semester 2 at UniS. Which means it's end of
year show (EOYS). It's looking like an awesome lineup and generally it's going
to be a fantastic couple of days. Wednesday it's Hed Kandi, Thursday it's Zane
Lowe (the day I'm working so VERY excited about that) and Friday day it's
Thorpe Park during the day and then Vernon Kay in the evening. Then sleep all
day on Saturday (although if I'm up to it I might head up to London to pick up
a certain person's birthday present - chances are I'll do it the weekend after
though).

_Then_, on Sunday Emma and I are motoring down to Portsmouth, catching the
ferry across to the Isle of Wight for two days. As of now we don't have any
plans, but Em is (supposed to be) doing some Googling for stuff to do. I want
to go to Osbourne House as I haven't been there for at least ten years. Who
knows where else we'll go? Maybe the needles, maybe Black Gang Chine (or at
least what's left of it).

Needless to say I plan to take lots of photos. But that's nothing new now, is
it?
