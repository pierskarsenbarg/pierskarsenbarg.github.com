If you live in the UK and have never ventured to Camden Town, why the hell
not? It's an awesome place, filled with the most wierd and wonderful
collection of shops and people I have ever come across.

One part of it is known as Camden Stables and it seems some low lifes in the
local council has decided to try to commercialise the area (boo! hiss!), not
realising that by doing do they are robbing not only those who work there, but
those people who live and breath the life-blood that is Camden.

So, I ask you to [sign this
petition](http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/camdenmarket/) and save this wonderful
area.
