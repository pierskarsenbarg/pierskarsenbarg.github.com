Yup, today is my second session at the gym. Last week I had a check up which
said I was overweight (but not obese woot!) which was not unexpected (I am a
little on the podgy front). I have to admit I'm quite looking forward to
starting to work out again. Lets hope that I can keep this going this time.
I'm doing some Bupa scheme which says that I'm supposed to go at least twice a
week. Since I have to walk past the gym on my way to and from work, I'm
constantly reminded that I should be going and Godalming's not exactly far
from Guildford so weekends aren't out of the question.
