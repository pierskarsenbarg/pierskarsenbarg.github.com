Well, I've started so I'll finish. Received an email from VCI systems (the
company reselling machines in the UK):

_Apologies in advance for any doubling up to those correspondents who may have
already received similar from the US, or been included other mail outs. A
Drobo unit with no drives is £350.00 inclusive of VAT with UK shipping at
£14.95 A bundled unit including 2 x 320Gb drives is also available at £499.00.
We are expecting stock into the UK in the coming week. Best regards Robert
Creech_

So, 640 Gb with Drobo for £499? Not too bad. Probably going to wait for some
reviews first (although if ayone from VCI is reading this and fancies loaning
me one...)
