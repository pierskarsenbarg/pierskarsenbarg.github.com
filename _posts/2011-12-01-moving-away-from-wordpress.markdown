So yes, as the title says above, I'm trying to move away from Wordpress. Not that Wordpress isn't any good. I just want a nicer way of creating a blog, I can't be bothered to keep a server up and running and I wanted to try something different. So I'm using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) combined with Github's [Pages](http://pages.github.com) way of doing things. It means that I'm not hosting anything, pages are fairly simple to create and update and they all use Markdown which I quite like. 

Creating new pages on the move could be a bit of a pain in the backside, but I'm going to see if I can come up with a solution using the [Dropbox API](http://www.dropbox.com/developers) or something similar.

I'm using the basic layout that a few people use to start with, based on [Tom Preston-Werner's blog](http://tom.preston-werner.com) but I'm hoping to get something a bit different done. Maybe over Christmas.

I'm also going to add disqus at some point. Not that many people actually comment, but I'd certainly feel better about it.
