So we finally got around to ordering DVDs for a whole pound(!) from play.com
on Sunday and I've now had two out of three emails to confirm that they've
been dispatched. Films ordered were [Surf's
Up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423294/),
[Hoodwinked](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443536/) and [Open
Season](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400717/). Personally I wasn't a great fan
of the third but haven't yet seen the other two so I can't pass judgement on
the other two.

Hopefully will get Hoodwinked today or tomorrow (since I got the "we've sent
this" email on the 11th) and I've just had the Surf's Up email today so that
should mean some good cartoon viewing over the weekend.
