I've just installed the new youtube app for my n95 and I have to admit I'm
impressed. I was expecting far more lag than I got and although sometimes it
had to catch up with itself, I'm just assuming that was more to do with the
network than anything else. Now I just need to remember that I only have a gig
a month data plan so I mustn't watch too much.
