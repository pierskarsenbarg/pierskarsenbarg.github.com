I think I say this every so often, but this week I'm _definately_ going to
make a concerted effort to start on this project that I've been wanting to do
for ages. It's going to be quite a major undertaking as it's going to involve
a few web services. I was thinking about doing it in RoR but I think I'm going
to stick with what I know best (i.e. PHP).

I've had a database schema in my head now for a while, so I need to get that
into a database (or at least the first implementation of it) and then actually
start working on the site. There's going to be a fair bit going on in the
background as well, since there's quite a lot of stuff like video encoding
(which is where the web services will come in as I plan to use AWS to do a lot
of the hardcore stuff). But that will come later.

The thing that bothers me is that the site is very heavily based on User
Generated Content (seems to be a bit of a buzzword at the moment), but it's
content that I can't put together myself. Don't want to give too much away at
this point, but it involves music and unsigned bands. Now, I'm not a band, so
I can't put stuff up. If anyone has any thoughts about how best to do this,
then please please let me know.
