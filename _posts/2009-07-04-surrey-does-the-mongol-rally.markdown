Bright and early (well about midday) I was up at Chancellors to see off the
team from USSU who were starting on their adventure, driving from Guildford to
Mongolia. The idea is that they drive there and then auction off the vehicles
they travel in.

I'd like to wish them the best of luck and look forward to reading their blog
updates. I'll post a link when I find out the URL. I've already post my photos
from the launch on Facebook and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/piers).

[Update]So far they've reaced Amsterdam (I believe). For more info you can
view their [Mongolia
Blog](http://mongolia.charityrallies.org/surrey2mongolia)[/Update]
