I first heard of [Drobo](http://ww.drobo.com) from the forever bouncy [Cali
Lewis](http://www.geekbrief.tv) about a month or so ago and emailed the
company to find out when it was going to be available in the UK (back then it
was only available in the US).

Now I'm happy to say that I've just received an email from Data Robotics (the
company that makes Drobo) saying that it's going to be available through [VCI
Systems](http://www.vcisystems.co.uk). Although there isn't anything on their
site at the moment, I'm sure they'll update it soon.

I've just tried to email them through the address that I was sent, but it
seems to have bounced back. Not a good sign.
