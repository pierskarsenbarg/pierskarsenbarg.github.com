For the past few years, I’ve been using a
[Bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/) VM to host my sites, but I’ve now begun
the move away from them to [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com/). I’ve just
successfully moved this blog and this weekend I’ll be moving my other sites.

This isn’t a dig at Bytemark. They’ve been awesome, but Slicehost is that
little bit cheaper and they’re part of Rackspace so I’m expecting big things
support-wise.

Also, they use more “default” images for their VMs (or “slices”) whereas
Bytemark create their own ones and I prefer to do more myself.
