I posted to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pierskarsenbarg/status/1212108120)
the other day that the trailer for the new Transformers film was a bit
lacklustre (or words to that effect). When the trailer for the first film came
out, I was very excited. After all, I'm an 80s child and they were HUGE back
then (if anyone asks, Bumblebee was blatently my favourite. The VW Beetle
version, not the Chevy one).

But the trailer for the new one (see below) doesn't excite me in the
slightest. Sure, I'll go and see it, but I'm really hoping the full length
film is a whole lot better than the trailer says it is.

  
As usual make sure you click to see the High-Res version, but see for
yourself. As for me, I'm not holding my breath.
