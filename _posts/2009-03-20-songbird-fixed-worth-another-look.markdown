According to [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5176177/songbird-ipod-add+on-
fixed) the [songbird](http://piersonthe.net/2009/03/11/songbird-the-magpie-of-
media-players/) [issue](http://piersonthe.net/2009/03/17/songbird-issues-with-
ipod-part-the-second/) that I might have mentioned a couple of times has been
fixed.

The question that I'm asking myself is do I want to risk it again? I've now
found out that there are a couple of tools for retrieving data from an iPod,
and as I said before I do have all my music on my laptop and my iPod is
generally plugged into my computer at work.

However, winamp is working quite nicely for me at the moment, so I could just
continue with that. Decision, decisions.
