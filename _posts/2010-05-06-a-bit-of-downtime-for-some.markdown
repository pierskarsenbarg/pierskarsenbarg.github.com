Just a couple of things... the first is that I've moved my blog to a Rackspace
Cloud server. I don't get many hits, so it was cheaper to get a bigger server
than staying on Slicehost. From the off-set it seems faster, although that
might be because it's from a clean install rather than an upgrade.

Therefore, as I stupidly deleted my old server a little prematurely. Those
who's DNS have already updated (like Google for example) will see it, but some
(like T-Mobile) who haven't updated will have to wait.

Other than that I've changed the theme of the blog. I quite like this, but who
knows how long I'll keep it like this until I get bored and switch to another
one.
