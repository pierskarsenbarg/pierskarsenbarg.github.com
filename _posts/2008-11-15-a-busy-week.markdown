I think I've just about caught up with my sleep now. It's been a busy week.
Most evenings spent working on [CompuCars](http://www.compucars.co.uk) which
finally went live about half 7 on thursday morning (I wasn't actually there
when it went live, having been in the office until 1am and then was back in
the office at 9am to make sure there was someone in to fix any bugs that were
let over).

Last night was at the [I.C.E.](http://www.ice.org.uk) in London. Was a good
night. Food was awesome! Didn't have my camera, but there are some photos
floating around.

And the rest of the weekend? Possibly Xmas shopping. Or at least thinking
about it.
