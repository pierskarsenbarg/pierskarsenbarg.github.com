Looking through the stats for my [Flickr
photos](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/) today and came across [two](http://im
ages.google.co.uk/images?q=illuminati%20air&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi)
[referrals](http://images.google.com/images?q=fire+illuminati) from Google
images, both of which bring back links to my
[Fire](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/160091470/) and
[Air](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/160086497/) tattoos.

A search for [water tattoos](http://images.google.com/images?q=water+tattoo)
was also bringing back my Water tattoo, but not until [page 5](http://images.g
oogle.com/images?hl=en&q=water+tattoo&start=72&sa=N&ndsp=18).

I'm assuming this is because of [this forthcoming
film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808151/), so more people are buying the
books.
