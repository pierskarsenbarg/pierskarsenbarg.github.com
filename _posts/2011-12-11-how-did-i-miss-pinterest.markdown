title: How did I miss Pinterest?
---

I've always prided myself at being the one person among my friends and colleagues who knew of things before everyone else. But one site that seems to have escaped my attention is [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com). How did I miss this? It's got all the things that I usually pick up on: social, bookmarks, the works. 

Unfortunately it's on invite only at the moment. I've signed up for an invite. Does anyone know how long it takes?
