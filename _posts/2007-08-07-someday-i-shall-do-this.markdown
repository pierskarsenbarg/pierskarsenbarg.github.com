I really really want to drive across the US one day. I've been to San
Fransisco. I'm probably going to Houston next year. But I'd love to drive
across the country.

I've been playing with Google Maps and I think that [this
route](http://piersonthe.net/uploads/Drive_US.kml) is the one I'd like to
take. It pretty much covers all of the major places I'd like to visit. Just to
take 2 or 3 weeks to do it sounds so wonderful.

Someday.
