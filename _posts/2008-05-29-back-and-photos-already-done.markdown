I think this is the fastest that I've had photos uploaded after a
holiday.[![](http://piersonthe.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/isle-of-wight-

wight-may-08-107.jpg)

You can see them in my Flickr account. The [big-ass
boat](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/2534232689/in/set-72157605315765336/)
right at the end is the new [Queen
Victoria](http://www.cunard.com/ourships/default.asp?ship=QV) (quite apt
having visited [Osbourne
House](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/2534994648/in/set-72157605315765336/)
that very day), the latest Cunard boat. The reason it's so blurry is because
we were quite far away so I had to use the digital zoom as well as the optical
one on my camera.

All the more reason to look into a
[DSLR](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/142534).
