In my emails this morning I had one from the guys at Twitter saying that they
were no longer sending updates to mobile phones. I understand why they've done
this. In the US the user pays to receive text messages whereas over here it's
the sender that pays. The email quotes that it would cost them approximately
$1000 per user per year so it's understandable why they'd shut this service
off.

However, this means that this is one less way to get your twitter fix, and no
real way to get real time updates if you don't have am iPhone or a Blackberry.

Now, I prefer not to get my updates via text. I find it too distracting,
although I do use it if there's some newsworthy event on where I want to
receive up to the minute info, but of course that won't be happening anymore.

Hopefully this means that the guys at twitter will be spending more money and
time on getting the xmpp feed up and running for everyone, but in the mean
time it looks like I'll be strapped to my laptop if i want to get the latest.
