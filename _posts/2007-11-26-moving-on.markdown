Before a couple of weeks ago I had never resigned from a company before to
move on somewhere else. Any part time jobs I had had I finished either because
I got snowed under with academic work or because I started my placement year.
My [placement year](http://www.otmnet.com) was only a year's contract so I
knew from day one when it would end. My [sabb year](http://www.ussu.co.uk) was
again only a year, so I knew when that would finish.

I've been casually looking at jobs, keeping an eye on the market. You know,
just seeing whats out there. I came across one that I thought I'd be
interested in, took the phone interview, met the MD and ended up with the job.
A lot more money than I'm currently getting, closer to home and I get to do
stuff in .NET.

The hardest part was handing in my notice. I've loved working at
[ETS](http://www.etsplc.com). I like to think that I've really come part of
their team and that they'll miss me.

At least I hope so. I'll miss them.

But, a new challenge awaits. New people to meet (which is one of the bits I
like about a new job). The only thing that kinda sucks is that I have to work
between Christmas and New Year. Having said that, Emma and I are going to
[Centerparcs](http://www.centerparcs.com) in January and we're both really
looking forward to it. It's a bit different from
[Rome](http://www.flickr.com/photos/piers/sets/72157600378780482/) this year,
but it should be good. Then we can start thinking about and planning our
summer holiday. Hopefully then I'll be able to drive (4th time lucky).
