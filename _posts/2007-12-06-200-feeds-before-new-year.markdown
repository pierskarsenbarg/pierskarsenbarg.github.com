I read a lot of feeds. Possibly not as many as [some
people](http://scobleizer.com/) but at the time of writing I've got to 191
(see [My OPML file](http://piersonthe.net/wp-
content/uploads/2007/12/piers.xml) for a list of them all - and yes I know
that mine's one of them, but it comforts me to know that my posts actually get
"out there"). My aim is to get to 200 feeds by New Year.
