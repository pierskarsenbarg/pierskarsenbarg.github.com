Yesterday saw the launch of [Taste for Politics](http://tasteforpolitics.com),
a site for people with any inclination, affiliation or opinion to post
articles to. I've got in touch with a few politically minded people so I'm
hoping that they will help me write a few articles to get it started.

The theme is one I found online, but I'm hoping to get one of my designer
colleagues to help me out there.
