title: One film that they HAVE to make a reality

---

Thundercats. [@codingbadger](http://twitter.com/codingbadger) tweeted tonight the [Thundercats theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRWDvVF3LxA) and it got me thinking. 

I've always been a huge fan of Thundercats. I watched it as a small boy, and I've watched it again as an adult and I still love it. All the characters are awesome. It's one of those cartoons that gives a definite message (especially since they actually have a slot at the end of the program to spell it out, like so many other cartoons of the 80s did).

There is a [fake trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb50GMmY5nk) on Youtube (bonus points if you can name all the movies used in it) that must have taken AGES to make (apparently the creator photoshopped each individual frame), but nothing would beat an actual film being made.
