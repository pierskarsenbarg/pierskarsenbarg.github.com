The bit that really made me laugh (and everyone in the office to look
strangely at me) was that the guy who is playing [Karl
Rove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove) in
[W](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1175491/) played Dobby the House Elf in the
Harry Potter films.

I always knew there was something evil about that elf...
