It's been just over a week now, but last Tuesday I finally passed my driving
test!! It's only taken me about 9 years to do so. I'm going down to Portsmouth
tomorrow to test drive a car (a [Peugeot
307](http://www.compucars.co.uk/Peugeot_307) to be precise). It all depends on
a couple of financial things, but with any luck I'll be driving it back up to
Guildford on Sunday night.
