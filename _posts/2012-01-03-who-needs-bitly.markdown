title: Presenting TinySharp
---

One of my New Year's Resolutions was to write more code. And so I have. I present to you: [TinySharp](http://github.com/pierskarsenbarg/tinysharp). 

It's my own C# implementation of code that was originally written in Ruby by Kyle Bragger (he of Forrst fame). I then wrote a version in PHP (tidied up by Kyle) but I've wanted to write a version in C# (since most of my work is .NET related). So I did it tonight. And I'm quite proud of my work.
