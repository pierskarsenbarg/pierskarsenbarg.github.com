Last time I went to [Center Parcs](http://www.centerparcs.co.uk)Â was about a
month before I went to University. It's really odd to think of all that's
happened over the past (just over) 5 years since then.

Anyway, I'm going to be incommunicado until Friday evening, although I will
probably be reading the occasional email. I'll post as many photos I can onto
my [Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/piers).
