title: It's Christmas (shopping) Time
---

So I was planning on doing all my Christmas shopping online this year. So far it hasn't happened. I'm still planning on getting some things from Amazon (18th is apparently the last day with guaranteed delivery before Christmas) but I'm pretty sure that I'm going to have to venture into London this weekend. Which I'm really not looking forward to. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to go in London that won't have a mass of other people (and tourists) doing the same?
