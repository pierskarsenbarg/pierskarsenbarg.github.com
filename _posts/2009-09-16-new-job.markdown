It's been about a week now since I handed in my notice, so it's probably about
time that I posted something up here. Yes, I've got a new job!

I'm going to be working for a company called [Pull
Digital](http://www.pulldigital.com) (take a look at the website to see what
they do), doing web development (.NET, some Sharepoint stuff by the looks of
things) and I'm excited.

Some people have said that they find moving to a new company stressful, but
I've never found that. I relish the challenge of meeting new people, working
out how the company works and finding my niche amongst people who have their
own unique way of working.

I've really enjoyed my time at UK Web Sites, but I felt that it was time to
move on, meet new people and move on with my career.
