I love bank holidays. Not because I don't have to go to work (I'm really
enjoying my job at the moment) but because Emma and I always do something.
Since she works at weekends, we don't often get to spend a lot of time doing
stuff together so we make sure that we defintely do something on Bank
holidays.

Today was no different. Up early (kind of) we went to [The Vyne](http://www.na
tionaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-thevyne/), a 16th century
house [near Basingstoke](http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=f

0819,0.080338&t=h&z=14&iwloc=addr), then drive back to The Good Intent, a
really nice pub in Puttenham, then off to Puttenham common for a walk.

Was a really hot day, and we're both tired. But it was a really really nice
day. Roll on the summer holiday!
