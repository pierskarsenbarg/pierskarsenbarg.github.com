[![BBC Cock Up](http://piersonthe.net/wp-
content/uploads/2007/08/bbc_oth.thumbnail.jpg)](http://piersonthe.net/wp-
content/uploads/2007/08/bbc_oth.jpg)... as it admits to me watching One Tree
Hill, but I also love it when something as mainstream as the BBC makes a cock-
up. You would have thought that one of the biggest media companies in the
world would at least do a bit of research for their news. Anyone who watchs
OTH would know that Chad Murrey Michaels doesn't play Nathan...
