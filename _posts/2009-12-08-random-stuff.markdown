I used to post most of the random stuff that I found on the interwebs here,
but I've started using Posterous more and more. I don't think I'm going to be
using it as a blogging tool as I like the flexibility that hosting my own
Wordpress blog allows, but the ease of posting links and content via email is
so much easier. I also love the way it handles multiple image posting - see
[here](http://random.piersonthe.net/photos-from-phone) to see what it does.

So to see more of the stuff that you used to see here, go to
[http://random.piersonthe.net](http://random.piersonthe.net)

I'm also going to post the RSS feed to it over there on the right -->
