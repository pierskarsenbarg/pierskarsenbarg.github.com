The previous post was me testing [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) (my
bookmarking tool of choice)'s "post to blog" tool. I might leave it to do its
thing for a while. I'm also trying [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com)
at the moment to find new content, so some of that I'll probably post to
del.icio.us and thereby to the blog.

I'll try it for a while. I might keep it. I might not. Who knows?
