It's that time of the year again. After having missed out on Guilfest last
year (due to a conflict with my mother's birthday) I'm going back to Stoke
Park this weekend. Bands that I'm looking forward to seeing are Motorhead,
Athlete, Lightening Seeds, Toploader, possibly Pendulum and DJ Yoda if we can
get into the tent, Brian Wilson, The Wailers and probably a few more. Slight
disappointed that Hundred Reasons aren't playing any more, but c'est la vie.

If I get the chance I'll post some photos from my phone to
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/pierskarsenbarg), otherwise I'll post the ones I
take with my camera on FB and Flickr on Sunday night/Monday at some point.
