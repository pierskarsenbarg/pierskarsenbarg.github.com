And what have I done? I don't really know if I'd call this year a busy one. It
doesn't really feel like it. I can't believe it's nearly a year since [Emma
and I went to Rome for New
Year](http://www.flickr.com/photos/piers/sets/72157600378780482/). So what has
happened since then?

There's been another holiday, this time to
[Menorca](http://www.flickr.com/photos/piers/sets/72157600583606207/). We took
less photos, but this was less a sight seeing holiday, which Rome definately
was, than a "getting away" holiday. The next one is in a couple of weeks to
[Center Parcs](htp://www.centerparcs.co.uk) which will definately **not** be a
relaxing holiday, but I'm really looking forward to it.

Admittedly it was a very recent thing, but I've changed jobs. My old job at
[ETS](http://www.etsplc.com) was a lot of fun, but it was time for me to move
on and I'm really enjoying the work I've been doing so far at [UK
Websites](http://www.ukwebsites.net).

Other than that, things have been ticking along nicely. I think there are
definately some things that I would like to have done, and maybe in the New
Year some of those things will come to fruition. However, I'm very happy with
the way things have gone this year and hope that the year to come will bring
some new challenges for me.
