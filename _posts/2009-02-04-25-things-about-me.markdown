I posted this as a note on my facebook profile, but I thought I would post it
here as well:

1. I broke my arm when I was 6 and I can't twist it round

2. I have seven tattoos

3. I love black pudding

4. It took me 4 attempts over a period of 9 years to pass my driving test

5. My all time favourite film is Lost in Translation

6. I've met Terry Pratchett and got him to sign a card for a friend who's
appendix had exploded

7. I'd like to own a bar one day

8. The smell of cat food makes me retch

9. At some point in my life I want to run my own business

10. I've been wearing glasses for over 20 years

11. There is photographic evidence that I first got into computers when I was
5

12. I only have two phobias (that I can think of) - needles and jellyfish

13. I'm only superstitious about magpies and three drain covers in a row (is
that weird enough for you Wes?)

14. I really want to visit Japan (that might have something to do with my
favourite film)

15. When I was very young (3 or 4 maybe?) I got lost in Harrods. After
panicking, my mum found me in the food hall being fed by a nice lady who
worked there

16. I've never skied or snowboarded

17. I am allergic (though not severely) to cherry tomatoes and gala melons

18.I shave my hair very short, but if it was long it would be quite wavy. Some
might say curly.

19. The album that I put on if I'm feeling really down is Meatloaf's Bat Out
of Hell 2. There's nothing quite like having that blasting out of a stereo

20. I'm a bit strange when it comes to some food. I eat most things except
fish. However i like some fish, like cod (but only when in the form of fish
fingers or battered from the local chippy) and smoked salmon. But I don't like
cooked salmon.

21. If I ever have any daughters I will be incredibly protective over them.
Think of that scene from Bad Boys 2 ([http://youtube.com/watch?v=o3NQaU7awPI](

22. There is nothing better than the taste of something that has been
barbecued

23. I really like Dr Pepper and wish we could get it on draught over here

24. Even though I sucked my thumb for many years, I have never needed braces

25. I used to work in the restaurant and various caf√©s in Debenhams in
Guildford. The customer lift there (allegedly) isn't earthed properly and I
ALWAYS used to get a shock from the buttons. To this day, I can't touch a
button in a lift with bare skin. That's pavlov for you.
