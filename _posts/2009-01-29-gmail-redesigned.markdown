One of the big items of news yesterday was that Gmail had been "taken offline"
(see [here](http://bit.ly/1oip) for more details). Now, that doesn't mean a
lot to me as with my G1 I can have my gmail offline all the time and have done
since last month, so I was far more interested to see that they've also done a
bit of a redesign on the system as well.

Gone is the green label for labels, and in general the colours have turned
more pastelly, more asthetically pleasing.

I have to admit I quite like it.
