title: No I Don't Have A Facebook Account
---

I don't have a Facebook account. I've not had one for [over a year now](/2010/11/24/quitting-facebook/). OK, I have one that I use for work (no really!) but it's completely hidden and I don't have any friends on it. 

It's really starting to nark me off how websites don't allow you to use them to their full extent because I don't have a Facebook account. Take Spotify for example. I'd be more than happy to pay the &pound;9.99 a month for Spotify Premium. But I can't use it because you need a Facebook account to even register nowadays. 

It was really brought to ahead tonight with an email from the website formally known as 4SquareAnd7YearsAgo. It's an awesome website that sends you emails to tell you were you checked in on Foursquare a year ago. Sounds silly, but it's sometimes fun to see what you were up to. A bit like [Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/timecapsule/), which sends you twice monthly emails with photos that you posted on Flickr a year ago (I'm not posting on Flickr so much anymore as I just take a photo and upload it to Twitter). But I digress. Anyway, so I got an email saying that they've changed their name to [Timehop](http://timehop.com) and are now including stuff like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. So, I clicked on the site to move my data over and they suggest that now I have to wait they can support me. 

It's not like they don't already have details on me from Foursquare, and I'd be more than happy to signup with Twitter instead, but it kinda makes me feel like a second class web citizen (is that the right phrase?).

Anyway, it just made me think about how many sites don't let you sign up without Facebook. I understand why. There's a huge wealth of data available from people who link these web apps to Facebook, and it means that you the user doesn't need to fill out more stuff again, but come on guys! Not everyone wants to sign their data and privacy away to Facebook. 

And it's not like I'm a person who isn't all over the web. Just [google my name](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Piers+Karsenbarg). And it's not difficult to get in touch with me. Hell I have my phone number on my [CV](/piers-karsenbarg-cv) which is online and easy to search. I just don't like the idea of having everything in one place. I like the share my online love. 

So, to those people who are creating new web apps that you need a Facebook account to use, think of the 6,040,507,000 people in the world who don't have Facebook accounts and give us a way to use your site, give you our money and do it without having to use Facebook.
