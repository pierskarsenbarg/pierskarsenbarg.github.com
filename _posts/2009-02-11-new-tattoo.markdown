As I wrote in my last post, I've just got a new tattoo. The design is one I've
wanted to get done for about 5 or 6 years, so to finally have it done is a
real milestone for me.

It was originally going to be my first tattoo, but I chickened out and got a
smaller one instead. However, I've finally got it done and am very happy with
the result. It's still going through its manky scabby stage (sounds worse than
it actually is) but the photos that I've taken so far can be found in [this
set on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/piers/sets/72157594158436048/).

If anyone is curious, I got it done at [Jon Nott Custom
Tattoos](http://www.codebrothers.co.uk/index.html) up Manor Road in Guildford
by [Aim√©e Lou](http://www.myspace.com/aimeeloutattoo).
