Apple finally announced today that us poor folk in the UK will be able to
download TV programs (but not yet movies) from the iTunes Store. Being the
ever curious person that I am, I downloaded [Make Love, Not
Warcraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Love,_Not_Warcraft), the South
Park episode thats half South Park, half WoW Machina (movies made using games
for those that don't know).

On the whole, pretty cool. at only Â£1.89 an episode, that's not really that
bad. The download was fairly speedy and the quality wasn't too bad. The only
thing that lets it down is the lack of content available at the moment (no CSI
and no movies yet, at least in the UK) but hopefully that will change pretty
quickly, especially as Google is no longer a competitor.
