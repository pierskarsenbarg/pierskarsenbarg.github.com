So the World Cup is nearly upon us. In fact as I write this it's something
like 23 days away. So I decided to put all the matches in a handy to digest
format, otherwise known as a Google shared calendar.

The iCal version can be found here:

The XML version can be found here:
[http://bit.ly/worldcupcal2010xml](http://bit.ly/worldcupcal2010xml)

The HTML version (easily viewable in a browser) can be found here:
[http://bit.ly/worldcupcal2010html](http://bit.ly/worldcupcal2010html)

So far it's just the Group Stages, and as soon as the results are out, I'll
add the stage 2 dates in there as well.
