[![O2 on safari](http://piersonthe.net/wp-
content/uploads/2007/09/o2_small.jpg)](http://piersonthe.net/wp-
content/uploads/2007/09/o2_small.jpg)Ok, lets get the preamble out the way:
iPhone blah blah Uk blah O2 blah.

Finished?

Paul Annett, over on [his blog](http://paulannett.co.uk/), has pointed out
that even though they have been deemed great enough to be the ones to offer
the iPhone (officially of course, since it's apparently very easy to unlock it
to other networks) the O2 website can't be used correctly on (of all things)
Safari, the very same browser that (wait for it) ships with the iPhone.
