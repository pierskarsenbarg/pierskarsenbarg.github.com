I'm very excited today. Not because the weather has finally turned nice. Not
because it's payday tomorrow (although that in itself a very exciting
thought). No the reason I'm excited is because I've bought myself a new
digital camera.

I used to have an Olympus mju (or however you spell it) but for some reason
the sliding front stopped working about a year ago. I could have got it fixed
but to be honest that was more fuss than it was worth and if it was still
operational today it would have been about 4 years old.

The camera I have bought is this one. A Canon IXUS wireless. 5 mega pixels so
quite an improvement on the last 3.2 MP beauty that the Olympus was. But
wireless as well. Apparently I can wirelessly print to any Pictbridge printer
or simply copy the photos to my (wireless) laptop.

The best thing of all though is the price. £100 including delivery. I'm pretty
sure it's a typo as Amazon charges about £250 - 300 for the same one, although
you can get a used one from Amazon marketplace for about £130.

So that's why I'm excited. Unfortunately it won't arrive for another week, so
I won't have it for Carol and Mike's wedding on Saturday but I'll try to
borrow Emma's for that day and post some up after that.

  
[Update - Woo it's left the warehouse. Might actually arrive here tomorrow
then!
