[The extended trailer](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewFeature?id=485056743&mt=1&s=143441) of what I think will be THE film of the year, [The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/). The film is of course based on the first novel from the hugely popular [Millenium series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_series) by the late author, [Stieg Larsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieg_Larsson). If you haven't seen the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/) [Swedish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216487/) [films](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343097/), I suggest you do. They are truly excellent. Although there are a few bits that do not stick to the original books, they are definitely worth seeing. 

When I heard that the films were being Americanised, I was concerned, but having watched the 8 minute long trailer I think [David Fincher](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/) (director of amongst other films [Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) and [The Social Network](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/)) has so far done an excellent job. 

If anyone is interested the release date is the 26th December. And I can't bloody wait.
