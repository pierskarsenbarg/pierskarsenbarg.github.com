Last summer was a shocker. "What summer?" I hear you cry. Exactly. Now, one
side of me loved last year, as it meant that I had no hayfever whatsoever.

However, I can already feel the pollen taking effect. My eyes are itchy. I'm
sneezing more than I usually do. So a bad sign for the hayfever, but it's a
good sign for the nice hot summer that we missed out on last year. The summer
before was awesome: lots of opportunities for barbeques, drinking in the
evenings etc. etc.

I really hope that it stays like this.

Dislaimer: I take no responsibility for jinxing the weather.
