I've been back from [Center Parcs](http://piersonthe.net/index.php/2008/01/06
/center-parcs/) for a couple of days now (well, since late Friday night) and
it's really not been my weekend. Yesterday I was feeling quite crappy due to a
head cold (probably due to some little bastard in the pool) and today I'm
biting down on a sandwich and find that half my tooth has cracked off! So I've
not really been that lucky.

I've had a look in the mirror andthere doesn't seem to be much left. I'm
really hoping that they can rebuild the tooth rather than removing it and
putting something there in its place as that sounds really painful.

And I'm going to have to miss some of tomorrow's work. So it's really not
going well.
