...again. Yes I know that this is the second time I've restarted my blog. But
I got encouraged by friend and client
[Wesley](http://www.livejournal.com/~kingsbishop/) from the
[DeepStar](http://www.deepstar.org/) project.

Well, I think I'll stick with this style for now, but I'm gonna look into
creating a new one. I'm pretty sure that I've said that before, but this time
it's gonna happen; I hope.
