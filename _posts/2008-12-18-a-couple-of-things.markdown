I got a new phone on Monday. The T-Mobile G1 (otherwise known as the Google
Phone). Very very nice. Very easy to use. Syncs email/contacts/calendar with
my google apps account very quickly.

I've just bought a couple of tracks off Amazon MP3 store - Friendly Fire's
[Paris](http://www.last.fm/music/Friendly+Fires/_/Paris) and Jeff Buckley's
version of [Hallelujah](http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Buckley/_/Hallelujah)
(none of that X-Factor crap for my MP3 player!) if anyone's interested. I was
so impressed at how it all just worked. Yes I had to download an extra piece
of software for it, but that was only about 700KB. The tracks downloaded very
quickly (are Amazon using their own version of
[CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for it?) and since they're DRM
free could just copy them straight to my G1 and play them instantly.

Very very impressed with both my purchases.
