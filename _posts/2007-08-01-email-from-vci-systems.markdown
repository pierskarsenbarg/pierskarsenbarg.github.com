(Reminder... VCI are the company in the UK selling the
[Drobo](http://piersonthe.net/index.php/2007/08/01/drobo-now-available-in-the-
uk/))

_Thank you for your recent enquiry. Drobo units are expected in the UK during
the week beginning 6th August and will be priced at £499 including VAT and
shipping to mainland UK. We will contact you to confirm when the stock is
available. Best regards Robert Creech_

Possibly a little more than I was planning on spending (£499 is about double
what you'd have to pay in the States), especially as you then have to pay for
your hard disks on top of that. Maybe I should buy myself one as a Christmas
present. It'll give me the chance to save up...
