I've finally got round to doingwhat I've said I wanted to do pretty much since
I started the first version of this blog 6 years ago, and that's writing some
code to release.

So yesterday I posted my [.NET wrapper](/code/sharp-ly) to the
[bit.ly](http://bit.ly) [API](http://bit.ly/pages/tools/developer-tools/). I'm
hosting it on [GitHub](http://github.com) as I've wanted a chance to use
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) for a while and it's free so it made a lot of
sense.

I'm going to be posting more stuff there and updating the [/code](/code) page
here on my site.
